I had read loads of pages, struggled through videos, implemented a dozen sites and yet everytime something went wrong due to me using the latest version of Webpack (version 5) or I got Webpack working without Pug or Node working with Pug without Webpack! These were frustrating days.


Read https://freshman.tech/learn-node/ on how to build your first Node.js website with Express and Pug

Then I ran across this article https://dev.to/aakatev/multipage-application-with-node-and-webpack-4nf4

and escpecially the express generator which is such a delight after all the above struggles.

`
npx express-generator --pug --git express-webpack-template
`

New to Pug? This is the cheatsheet https://devhints.io/pug
